# ShakesNLPCapstone
An exploration of Shakespeare's dramatic corpus with Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the use of NLP on the corpus of William Shakespeare's plays in three parts: 1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA), 2. Sentiment analysis, and 3. Classification supervised learning models. 

# Methods
Methods used are: descriptive statistics, data analytics, NLP, sentiment analysis, supervised machine learning

# Technologies
Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Supervised Classification Learning Models

# Overview
This project explored the use of an NLP approach to the collected plays of William Shakespeare. The first part sought used the Pandas library to assemble descriptive analytics on the corpus. The second part used the VADER code from NLTK to carry out sentiment analysis on a set of plays. The third part fit four classification supervised machine learning models to see if the models could classify text between history play and comedy and history play and tragedy. 

The corpus text was downloaded from the following page on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

The conclusion is that these three approaches were very effective additions to traditional methods of literary analysis and warrant further, more extensive exploration.
